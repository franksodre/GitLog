      "block": "Big news hit the developer world last week: on March 11, 2025, the TypeScript team at Microsoft announced they’ve ported the TypeScript compiler from its original TypeScript/JavaScript roots to Go, promising a jaw-dropping 10x performance increase. This move tackles long-standing gripes about slow compile times and sluggish editor performance, especially in massive codebases. Lead architect Anders Hejlsberg explained that JavaScript’s limits were holding them back, saying, ‘We’ve squeezed all we can out of it.’ The result? A native compiler that slashes build times and boosts the entire TypeScript ecosystem, from CLI to IDEs."
